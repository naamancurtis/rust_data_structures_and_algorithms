//! # Problem Solving Patterns
//!
//! This library contains solutions to various common programming problems.
//!
//! The solutions to these _(if attempted naively)_ would generally be solved
//! in **O**(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity, however through the correct application of
//! a pattern can generally be improved upon, often down to **O**(n).
